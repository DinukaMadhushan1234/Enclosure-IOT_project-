# Enclosure for IOT-Music Controller using Raspberry Pi-4

## Introduction
This repository contains SolidWorks design files for an enclosure specifically created as a part of an IoT project focused on self-controlled music playing using Raspberry Pi 4 Model B. The design provides full access to all necessary ports and includes ventilation for efficient heat dissipation.

## Project Description
The enclosure design mainly designed to hold Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, with features that optimize functionality within the IoT music control setup. Key highlights include:
- **Precision Cutouts:** Full accessibility to GPIO ports, USB, Ethernet, micro-HDMI, and power ports.
- **Enhanced Ventilation:** Openings that promote airflow and heat management to support intensive operations.
- **Aesthetic Design:** Blends functionality with a sleek appearance suitable for modern tech environments.

## File Contents
- **`Box_final.SLDPRT`**: SolidWorks part file for the main enclosure body.
- **`Parts`**: Contains SolidWorks part files for the box and cover.
- **`Assem_final.SLDASM`**: Assembly file that integrates the box, a rasberry pi4 and cover components.

## Usage Instructions
### Viewing and Editing
The `.SLDPRT` and `.SLDASM` files can be viewed and modified using SolidWorks.

### Customization
You are welcome to customize the design according to your needs.

## How to Contribute
I encourage contributions from you! Hereâ€™s how you can help:
- **Design Feedback**: Suggest improvements or enhancements to the design.
- **Feature Requests**: Recommend new features or modifications.
- **Bug Reporting**: Identify and report any issues with the design files.

## Acknowledgements
Thanks to the Raspberry Pi Foundation for providing detailed documentation on the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, and to all contributors for their valuable feedback.
